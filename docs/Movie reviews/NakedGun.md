**Opening Hook**  
Pamela Anderson and Liam Neeson share the screen in a murder mystery that struggles to be suspenseful, romantic, or even mildly engaging.

**Plot**  
Neeson plays a cop investigating a murder who ends up falling for the victim’s sister, played by Anderson. On paper, it’s a straightforward noir setup. On screen, it’s an awkward mix of genres that never finds its footing.

**The Good**  
Neeson does what he can, but the role keeps him far from his strengths. His presence is the only thing holding the film together, however loosely.

**The Bad**  
The film is poorly written, confusing, and rarely funny when it tries to be. The murder mystery is thin, and the romantic angle feels forced. They were lying to us all this time!

**The Absurd**  
Watching an actor of Neeson’s caliber wrestle with material this weak is almost more uncomfortable than the plot itself.

**Verdict**  
A misfire that wastes its cast and premise. Neeson survives, the film doesn’t. **4/10**
