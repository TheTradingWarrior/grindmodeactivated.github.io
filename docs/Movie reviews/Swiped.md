**Opening Hook**  
A dramatization of Whitney Wolfe Herd’s journey from Tinder co-founder to Bumble CEO delivers an engaging but uneven look at ambition, sexism, and the contradictions of tech culture.

**Plot**  
The film follows Wolfe Herd’s departure from Tinder after harassment by a fellow co-founder and her decision to launch Bumble — an app designed to give women more control in online dating. As Bumble grows, the story takes an ironic turn when its largest investor, Badoo’s founder, is exposed for toxic behavior himself, ultimately selling his stake to Blackstone, which backs Wolfe Herd as CEO.

**The Good**  
The story itself is compelling, spotlighting a founder who reshaped an industry built on male-centric power structures. It offers sharp contrasts between Bumble’s ideals and Tinder’s reputation, and the irony of its investor’s downfall adds narrative weight.

**The Bad**  
Whitney couldn't contribute to the movie as she had signed an NDA which leads me to worry about how true some of the stories are.

**Verdict**  
A worthwhile story that highlights an important shift in tech culture, though not always told with the nuance it deserves. **6.2/10**
