Sharing notes from GW6 across the main content creators:

## TL;DR

- **Zophar:** Triple Captain Haaland in GW6, Murilo ➝ Gabriel in GW7, Free Hit strongly considered for GW7.  
- **FPL Harry:** Wildcard active, Gabriel ➝ Van Dijk planned GW12/13, Triple Captain saved for Haaland/Salah later.  
- **FPL Raptor:** Wildcard active, weighing Gyokeres vs Richarlison/Saka/Mbeumo, Bench Boost targeted for GW9.  
- **FPL Focal:** Wildcard active, Haaland captain GW6, Salah move planned GW12, Bench Boost likely in GW7, possible Saka transfer if Palmer injury lingers.  

### Zophar

- **Disappointing GW5 with only minor returns**, rank dropped to 4.6M. Early transfers made: Watkins, Rogers ➝ Haaland, KDH.  
- **Main focus on Haaland Triple Captain in GW6 vs Burnley**, backed by City’s top attacking projections and huge NPXGI lead despite minor fitness doubts.  
- **Arsenal defenders priority assets** with standout clean sheet odds, Murilo planned ➝ Gabriel in GW7.  
- **Free Hit in GW7 under strong consideration**, Arsenal and United fixtures promising while current defense has poor odds.  
- **Projections show big upside with FH** (15% chance of 80+ vs 2% without), making it an analytically strong play.  
- Wildcard avoided, content with GW6 team, clear chip strategy set for coming weeks.  

### FPL Harry

- **66 points in GW5 with a bench boost**, rank up to 2.1M. Wildcard activated in GW6 to rebuild depth and stability.  
- **Haaland locked**, joined by **João Pedro for Chelsea fixtures** and **Gyokeres on Arsenal penalties**, midfield core of Bruno, Semenyo, Reijnders.  
- **Double Arsenal defense with Raya and Gabriel**, plus Tarkowski, Senessi, and Palace defenders for reliable DefCon points. Richards may later become Van de Ven.  
- **Stack weakest link in midfield**, KDH or Anderson under consideration with £0.6m spare.  
- **Gabriel ➝ Van Dijk planned around GW12/13** to cover Liverpool fixtures, **Triple Captain saved for Haaland or Salah** in later gameweeks.  
- Draft built deliberately **template and reliable**, designed to roll transfers and stay flexible.  

### FPL Raptor

- **GW6 Wildcard activated**, template base kept but doubts remain over Raya, Gabriel, Gyokeres, Stach. GW5 steady but reset aimed at long-term stability.  
- **Haaland and João Pedro locked**, Gyokeres under review despite penalties with alternatives considered: Richarlison, Saka, Mbeumo.  
- **Raya and Gabriel double Arsenal defense** questioned, with Van Dijk or Pope potential upgrades, while Tarkowski, Senessi, Anderson provide DefCon support.  
- **Midfield core of Reijnders, Bruno, Semenyo secured**, Stach budget filler but possible rotation issue if funds redistributed.  
- Alternative drafts tested: **shift Gyokeres/Stack funds into Saka**, or Gabriel ➝ Richards to open room for stronger attackers, though benching headaches remain.  
- **Bench Boost targeted for GW9**, fallback GW11, GW8 opportunistic option depending on fitness.  

### FPL Focal

- **Terrible GW5 with multiple blanks and red cards**, Wildcard triggered for GW6 to reset and prepare for Bench Boost.  
- Draft leans template: **Raya in goal**, defense of **Gabriel, Gvardiol, Senessi** for long-term clean sheets and DefCon reliability.  
- **Midfield locks: Ndiaye, Bruno, Reijnders, Semenyo**, Ndiaye on penalties with strong xG, Bruno among top for non-penalty XGI.  
- **Haaland captain despite yellow flag**, Salah switch eyed around GW12 for Liverpool run, **João Pedro and Gyokeres held for fixture upside** including Arsenal GW7–11.  
- **Bench Boost pencilled in for GW7**, Dubravka, Stach, Anderson, Mukiele with playable fixtures, GW9 backup if issues arise.  
- **Future transfer path to Saka possible** if Palmer injury lingers, £0.4m banked for flexibility, squad structured around DefCon and fixture-driven upside.
