Not a particularly easy week for elite managers - the median placement improved slightly WoW but still struggling quite a bit this season.
Major trends were :
- [ ] Almost every single manager dropped Gyokeres - which makes sense given injure. Reijnders, Mukiele & Gvardiol also got dropped but they were less favoured by elite managers, compared to Gyokeres
- [ ] Haaland remained the top pick, with some outliers trying out Saka - which turned out to be the best choice
- [ ] Igor Thiago got some love after a strong run and answered with 2 goals vs Newcastle. 8 goals in 11 games this season. Senesi was also a top pick but poor performance vs Villa
