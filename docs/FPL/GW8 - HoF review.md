Not a great week for HoF managers overall but most improved WoW.
Haaland remained the most selected player, followed by Senesi and Semenyo. Haaland was the dominant captain, with only 2 managers trying Saka and 1 Gyokeres.
Gabriel was the most subbed in player, which turned out ok with the Arsenal clean sheet. Saka also had 6 new managers selecting him. On the other hand, Pedro Porro, Selz & N. Williams were subbed out by 5 people.
