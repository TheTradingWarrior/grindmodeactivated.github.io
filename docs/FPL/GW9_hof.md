HoF did ok with the average ranking improving 400k places - [Anoop K](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/199318/event/8) is off to a great start, currently sitting at 20k.
Haaland is still dominating teams, followed by Semenyo. Gabriel was subbed in by 6 managers.
Gyokeres was subbed out by 6 managers, wondering if any changes after the 2 goals scored during the week. Saka got some love, with 8 managers subbing him in. Rodon was subbed by 12 managers for the game vs Burnley, which panned out quite badly as Leeds lost 2-0.
