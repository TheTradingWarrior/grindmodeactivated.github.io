### TLDR
* Semenyo and Haaland are the HoF best picks so far
* Liverpool to go on a series of easier games
* Semenyo has been performing very well but tough games ahead in GW8,10 & 11

### Elite players and performance

Chasing Arsenal defensive strength with easy fixtures was also a common play that played out well. On the underperforming side, Gyokeres, Senesi, Reijnders & B. Fernandes have disappointed

### FDR

Arsenal, Liverpool and City have the easiest calendar for the next 6GWs. Followed by Chelsea, that has an easy GW8 + 11. 
Watkins, Konsa, Rogers & co. had their shot at something good but time quickly ran out with their next fixtures materially harder than the previous. On the flip side, Liverpool to go on a easier run for next 6 games after a tough run.

### Measuring transfer pressure

Using expected points from SolioAnalytics I compare season to date expected points vs expected points for next 6 gameweeks. Players with strong HoF selection rate & an expected big drop in points (or increase in fixture difficulty) are under more pressure to be subbed out while players with a projected increase in points could be subbed in.

Semenyo has been performing very well but tough games ahead in GW8,10 & 11. Saka looks good for next few GWs, with few managers picking him still and favourable fixture run.
